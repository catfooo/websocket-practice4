# this part is not working and dk why
from app.jsx
return


<div>{messages.map((msg, index) => (
                <div key={index}>{msg.text}</div>
            ))}
            </div>

# however, when i first tried this, i could see things from 

// // emit message from server to user
    // socket.emit('newMessage', {
    //     from:'jen@mds',
    //     text:'hepppp',
    //     createdAt:123
    // })

this, from server js.
just text, 'hepppp'


so like i could see this text over the input field, but just once,
which indicates this can work by somehow, but couldnt find the way yet

I wanted to do project again from start but wanted to save the commits, because I thought I will be in need to read that again or start from there again. if I give up the progress I have done, I can simply delete the repo and fork again. but in this case, can I fork twice and make two repo? I am getting this error.

It seems like you're trying to push to a repository owned by Technigo, and unfortunately, you don't have permission to push directly to repositories owned by others unless you've been granted access.

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to clone a repository, remove the .git directory (which disconnects it from the original repository), and then upload it as a new repository on your GitHub account.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command, replacing the URL with the URL of the repository you want to clone:

git clone https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
Step 2: Navigate to the Cloned Repository

Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository:

cd original-repo
Step 3: Remove the .git Directory

Remove the .git directory, which contains the history and configuration of the cloned repository:

rm -rf .git
Step 4: Initialise a New Git Repository

Initialise a new Git repository in the current directory:

git init
Step 5: Create a New Repository on GitHub

Go to GitHub.
Ensure you are logged in to your account.
Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository".
Name your repository and provide any other details as needed, then click "Create repository".
Step 6: Add Remote Origin for the New Repository

In your terminal, add the URL of your new GitHub repository as the remote origin, replacing the URL with the URL of your new repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git
Step 7: Add Files to the New Repository

Add all the files in the current directory to the new repository:

git add .
Step 8: Commit the Files

Commit the added files with a commit message:

git commit -m "Initial commit"
Step 9: Push to GitHub

Push the committed files to your new GitHub repository:

git push -u origin main
If you named your default branch differently, replace main with the name of your branch in the last command.

Hope this helps

Unfortunately you are not able to fork the same repo twice. You can do how many clones as you would like to your local computer as long as you name them differently. If you rather want to try out different solutions in a specific period in your project you can always go back to a specific commit and start over from there.

I am not really sure if this answers your question, so please reach out if I misinterpreted your question.

# difference from WebSocket
: this seems to connect continuously. at websocket, once it connected, excuting the job, and disconnected, connection is not repeating. idk this makes difference at actual function or speed, but, at least, it looks like that to me bcs log?. 

# chatgpt
The behavior you're observing in the server logs suggests that the client is continuously connecting and disconnecting. This behavior might be due to the way Socket.IO handles connections and disconnections.

In Socket.IO, connections can be long-lived, and the client can automatically attempt to reconnect if the connection is lost. This is part of Socket.IO's resilience against network issues. When you see repeated "Client connected" and "Client disconnected" messages, it indicates that the client is making repeated connection attempts.

If you want to control or limit the reconnection behavior, you can configure it on the client side when initializing the socket. For example:

javascript
Copy code
const socket = io('http://localhost:3001', {
  reconnection: false, // Disable automatic reconnection
});
By setting reconnection to false, you disable automatic reconnection attempts.

Keep in mind that Socket.IO handles connections in a more complex manner compared to basic WebSocket. It supports features like automatic reconnection, event acknowledgment, and more, which might result in different connection/disconnection patterns in the logs.
